Hello! 

I just included this notepad files to tell you what I haven't been able to finish in my assignment 

- No Move lefts
	The game will not be able to detect if the player doesn't have any valid moves left, but it will detect when the gameboard is full and will end successfully
	in that case!





Thanks for spending your time marking my assignment, hopefully my code was somewhat readable!
